## What were some challenges you faced while making this app?
- State Synchronization: Managing real-time updates between player/AI boards and ensuring turns were
properly alternated.

- Drag-and-Drop Logic: Implementing ship rotation and collision detection while maintaining grid alignment.

- AI Behavior: Creating a non-repeating random targeting system that felt "fair" to play against.

- Responsive Styling: Ensuring boards displayed correctly on mobile devices without visual clutter.

##Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make?
- Interactive tutorial for first-time users.
- Design Changes: 3D visual effects for sinking ships.

##What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?
- Players understand Battleship rules, so no in-depth tutorial was included.

- AI simplicity (random targeting) was acceptable for project scope.

- Users would prioritize functionality over advanced styling.

- Local storage was optional for state persistence unless specified.
## How long did this assignment take to complete?
